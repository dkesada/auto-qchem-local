## Introduction

‚ùó This is an experimental, modified version of [Auto-QChem](https://github.com/doyle-lab-ucla/auto-qchem) where I have taken down all components related with the Slurm scheduler, MongoDB and cloud management so that it can be run locally only by installing the Python library from GitHub. I've simplified the package as much as possible so that the relevant functions that create .gjf files, extract Gaussian .log properties, calculate Morfeus descriptors and generate .csv datasets can be accessed from a simple api defined as an object. Once the user instantiates this object, all functionality can be accessed easily. 

Keep in mind that this also means that all concurrent computations are now performed sequentially locally unless you define them otherwise. With that said, the only functions that are time consuming are the Morfeus calculations. Depending on the molecule and the number of conformers, this can take quite a while. For example, calculating the descriptors of a molecule with 90 atoms and a metal component with 5 conformers can take around 15-20 minutes on an average machine, while calculating this same molecule on 1 or 2 conformers can take up to 3-4 minutes. Simpler molecules without metal atoms will take less time and will have less failures in the conformer optimization of Morfeus.

The idea of this fork is to provide the possibility to perform their own calculations to any lab that wants to do them, even if they do not have a cluster infrastructure.

## Quick links

### Installation instructions

You will need to install this autoq-chem version from GitHub with the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp.git
```

Also, beware that Morfeus calculations **only** work on Linux (and maybe MacOS, but I haven't tried it) machines, because they need the xtb handler for Python, and that is only available in Linux. This will not work on Windows.

### Code structure

The main functionality of the package is separated into different objects inside the [api](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/tree/master/autoqchem_local/api) module: the `GjfGenerator` class that controls the generation of Gaussian input files, the `MorfeusGenerator` class that controls the morfeus calculations, the `LogExtractor` class that controls the extraction of information out of Gaussian .log files and the `AutoChem` controller class that serves as the main entry point to the package.

### Usage examples

In the [markdowns](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/tree/master/markdowns) folder there are some examples on how to use the package as a script tool with `argparse`. The [main_api.py](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/blob/master/markdowns/main_api.py) shows how to use the `AutoChem` class as the main entry point to the api of the package. Each of these components can be used independently, but I would say that using only the `AutoChem` class is the easiest way to use the package.

As for a full example, we have prepared some files and folders to showcase how to use this package. Inside the [markdowns](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/tree/master/markdowns) folder, there is the [example](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/tree/master/markdowns/example) directory with some example files and folders that we will use in the following sections.

#### Input .gjf files generation

Let's start with the generation of .gjf files. For this, the only thing we require is a single .smi file with a SMILES code per line for each of the compounds we want to analyze with Gaussian. An example .smi file is stored [here](https://github.com/dkesada/auto-qchem_exp/tree/master/markdowns/example/input_gaussian_files). In this case, we would have a folder like this:

Then, we only need to use the `AutoChem` class to generate the .gjf files from this .smi file:

```{python}
from autoqchem_local.api.api import AutoChem

controller = AutoChem(log_to_file=True)
controller.generate_gjf_files(path_to_smi_file)
```

This will generate a separate .gjf and .smi file for each SMILES in the original .smi file.

#### Full dataset generation

In the future I'll add some examples on how to use this package locally. It is simplified enough so that in a few function calls one can have a full dataset with the descriptors of the desired molecules.
